Supported groupings are PROVIDER, DISTRIBUTION, CUSTOMER and REGION.\nBy specifying the distributionId as an additional filter the query will run just for the specified distribution.\n\n---",

This works in the background by maintaining BGP sessions in each site which announce the Floating IP routes through the border routers.\n\nFloating IP addresses which do not have an anchor IP address have no route, and are thus effectively nullrouted.\n\n### How to configure Floating IPs on a server\n\nOn the server, Floating IPs should be setup like any other additional IP address.  However, the same Floating IP will have to be setup on all servers that you want to be able to route it to.\n\nNote: Currently, Floating IPs does not work on VPS or Cloud servers.",
